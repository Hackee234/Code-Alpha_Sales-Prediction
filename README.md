## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to **predict future sales** using machine learning models.  
We use advertising data containing:

- TV advertising spending
- Radio advertising spending
- Newspaper marketing spending
- Sales revenue (target)

Following the PDF instructions:

This project covers:

- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations
- Feature selection
- Linear Regression & Random Forest models
- Model evaluation (RMSE, R²)
- Saved prediction model (`model_sales.pkl`)
